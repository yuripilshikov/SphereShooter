# SphereShooter

 A tutorial game project from book, with some my improvements.
 
 Game is simple: this is a classic twin-stick shooter. You have a boat with mounted turnable cannon, and some spheres wanting to smash your boat. 
 
 Left joystick is for movement, right - for turning cannon (shoots when right joystick is in extreme position). One shot is enough for small sphere, but 3 for big one. Green boxes adds health.
